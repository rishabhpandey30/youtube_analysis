# YouTube Trending Video Analysis & Prediction (India 2017â€“2018)

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting trends in YouTube videos using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. Using real-world data from India's trending videos in 2017 and 2018, the aim is to understand what makes a video go viral and whether we can accurately predict its performance.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed:
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.
**Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful insights from video metrics.
**Predictive Modeling** using:
**Linear Regression** to predict the view count.
**XGBoost Classifier** to determine if a video will trend or not.


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Source**: Kaggle â€“ [YouTube Trending Video Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new)
**Focus**: Indian region (`INvideos.csv`)
Features include: `title`, `channel_title`, `category_id`, `views`, `likes`, `dislikes`, `comment_count`, `publish_time`, etc.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models & preprocessing)
- XGBoost (Boosting algorithm for classification)
- 

## Key Goals

- Understand engagement metrics and their influence on video popularity.
- Predict future view counts with Linear Regression.
- Classify whether a video will trend using XGBoost.
- Gain deeper insights into YouTube's trending dynamics.
  

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- ðŸŽ¯ Build a **web application** to allow users to input video details or links and get predictions instantly.
- ðŸ”— Use YouTube Data API to auto-fetch video stats via URL.
- ðŸŽ¨ Improve visualizations and interactivity with dashboards.
